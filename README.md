## Autogen-Conveyer
![Group 74](https://github.com/hherpa/IntelliLex-RU/assets/146547175/e64f6c03-6099-4b22-8234-a290cd17fb9c)

Autogen-Conveyer is a fully automated approach to create a multi-tiered system for performing complex tasks of a huge range of orientation, the components of which are departments of agents-LLM (autogen group chats) focused on specific tasks.

Also Autogen-Conveyer is not separable from the functional approach: "1 department - 1 function" and "1 agent - 1 sub-function". Rough formatting of information (up to templating the result of each sub-function) also contributes to the accuracy of this approach. This is what gives us the opportunity to use Autogen-Conveyer as multilevel neural network systems with high accuracy and a limitless range of tasks.
